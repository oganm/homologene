\title{Query DIOPT database}
\usage{
diopt(genes, inTax, outTax, delay = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{genes}{A vector of gene identifiers. Anything that DIOPT accepts}

\item{inTax}{taxid of the species that the input genes are coming from}

\item{outTax}{taxid of the species that you are seeking homology. 0 to query all species.}

\item{delay}{How many seconds of delay should be between queries. Default is 10
based on the robots.txt at the time this function is written.}
}
\value{
A data frame
}
\description{
Query DIOPT database (\url{https://www.flyrnai.org/cgi-bin/DRSC_orthologs.pl}) for orthologues.
DIOPT database uses multiple tools to find gene orthologues. Sadly they don't have an
API so this function queries by visiting the site and filling up the form. By default
each query will take a minimum of 10 seconds due to \code{delay} parameter. This
is taken from their robots.txt at the time this function is written.
Note that DIOPT is not necesariy in sync with homologene database as provided in this package.
}
\details{
DIOPT does not support all species available in the homologene database. The supported
species are:

\describe{
    \item{4896}{Schizosaccharomyces pombe}
    \item{4932}{Saccharomyces cerevisiae}
    \item{6239}{Caenorhabditis elegans}
    \item{7227}{Drosophila melanogaster}
    \item{7955}{Danio rerio}
    \item{8364}{Xenopus (Silurana) tropicalis}
    \item{9606}{Homo sapiens}
    \item{10090}{Mus musculus}
    \item{10116}{Rattus norvegicus}
    \item{3702}{Arabidopsis thaliana}
}
