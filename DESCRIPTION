Description: A wrapper for the homologene database by the National Center for
    Biotechnology Information ('NCBI'). It allows searching for gene homologs across 
    species. Data in this package can be found at <ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/HomoloGene/build68/>.
    The package also includes an updated version of the homologene database where 
    gene identifiers and symbols are replaced with their latest (at the time of
    submission) version and functions to fetch latest annotation data to keep updated.
